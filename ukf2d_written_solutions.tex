\subsection{State Vector}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{x}_t=\begin{bmatrix}
  z \\
  \dot z
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Prediction Step}

\subsubsection{Control Input}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{u}_t = \begin{bmatrix}
  \ddot z
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{State Transition Function}

\begin{equation}
  g(\mathbf{x}_{t-\Delta t}, \mathbf{u}_t, \Delta t) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?} & \todo{?} \\
  \todo{?} & \todo{?}
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{x}_{t-\Delta t} + \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?} \\
  \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{u}_t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Measurement Update Step}

\subsubsection{Measurement Vector}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{z}_t = \begin{bmatrix}
  r
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Measurement Function}

\begin{equation}
  h(\mathbf{\bar x}_t) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?} & \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{\bar x}_t
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Measurement Covariance Matrix}

Populate the measurement covariance matrix $\mathbf{R}_t$ with a reasonable value for the variance $\sigma^2_r$ of the range reading $r$.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{R}_t = \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
